# Manufacturing Level

![](/Pic/manufacturinglevel.jpg)

- Level 1: Parts manufacturing—this includes non-painted parts and molding parts on the component level.
- Level 2: Piece Parts Sub Assembly—some level of assembly.
- Level 3: Metals and plastics are integrated together and shipped as a case (i.e. chassis).
- Level 4: Metals and Plastics + PSU and/or Flat Cable and/or Backplane are shipped as a kit or bag.
- <font color="red">Level 5: All enclosure parts from Level 4 attached, cables integrated, I/O tested</font>
- <font color="red">Level 6: Integration of motherboard into chassis enclosure and power on test.</font>
  - Level 6 manufactured platforms are what ODMs provide when they ship out “server barebones” which are integrated motherboard/chassis combinations with parts included, but missing components such as CPU, memory, hard drives, networking cards, etc. Often systems integrators will buy these barebones and populate with components to create specific server configurations. How much value that integrator can add in terms of services and further building out the solution depends on their capabilities in the next levels: 
- Level 7: Integration of add-on cards into server barebone with ability to test.
- Level 8: Integration of hard drives into server barebone with ability to test.
- Level 9: Integration of CPU and memory into server barebone with ability to test.
- <font color="red">Level 10: Full assembly of server with full system and component level testing, OS/software integration, product kitted with user manual and other required documentation and delivered as a fully-integrated server solution.
A manufacturer capable of up to Level 10 manufacturing will deliver a working server solution. But if you need multiple servers networked together as a rack-level or even multi-rack level solution, you will need at least a 
Level 11 manufacturer (like AMAX):</font>

- Level 11: Node-level assembly, testing, OS/software loading of all server nodes followed by rack cabinet assembly of nodes into racks with full cable networking (including switches), and tested as a working total solution at the rack or multi-rack level.
- Level 12: Rack to multi-rack level manufacturing featured in Level 11 including all networking with full software loading, validation and optimization. This may include but is not limited to cluster management, cloud OS (such as OpenStack) and networking software.
