# The Server Industry
**The server market is dominated by big brand vendors, suchas IBM, HP, Dell, Oracle, Cisco, Lenovo, Fujitsu, etc.**

&emsp;&emsp;Technically, a server is a computer or device on a network that manages network resources. It performs tasks on behalf of clients and facilitates the sharing of data, information, and hardware and software resources. In multiple operating systems, a server could refer to the program that is managing resources rather than the entire computer (Webopedia). Servers can be classified into different categories. Depending on the functionality, there are communication servers, database servers, media servers, web servers, application servers etc. Depending on their size and sophistication, there are rack servers, tower servers, miniature servers, blade servers, ultra-dense servers, super servers, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;From a configuration point of view, a server is quite similar to a computer, because both have components such as a bare board, a processor, memory, hard drives, network connections, power supply etc. Yet, a server is different from a desktop or laptop computer in three major ways: 
- First, a server is designed to carry out heavy-duty back-end tasks, which support desktop or laptop applications. For example, a server can be dedicated to host databases, while a computer only runs the interface of the databases and retrieves data. 
- Second, the most important component for both a server and a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), which has a small cache to store frequently used data. A desktop or laptop may have one or two sets of CPU, but the size of cache is quite limited; while a server has larger and more varied caches, which increases the processing power substantially.
- Third, a desktop or laptop often has only one hard drive, while a server has several hard drives configured into a single disk, called Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAIDs). In this case, failure of one hard drive does not mean the failure of a server, as other hard drives back up the system.
